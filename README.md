# Russia's oil and wheat exports
Amid the pressure to adopt more economic sanctions against Russia, two questions have appeared in everyone's minds: which countries depend on Russian oil and what could happen to already vulnerable countries such as Yemen or Sudan, both heavily reliant on Russian and Ukrainian wheat to survive. <br>
<br>
For this story we used export data, back to 2017, related to petroleum and wheat as reported by the Russian Federation to [UN Comtrade](https://comtrade.un.org/). Analyzing the data we realized that China and the Netherlands are among the main buyers of Russian oil, followed by Belarus and Germany. Neither China or Belarus, allies of Russian military offensive, nor any European country currently support a halt on Russian petrol, what limits the harming effect US and British ban will be able to achieve. <br>
<br>
For the second graph, mingling UN Comtrade data with the World Food Programme (WFP) [global food insecurity map](https://hungermap.wfp.org/), we found four countries heavily dependent on Russian wheat where at least 20% of their population already suffer from insufficient food comsuption. Those nations are Nigeria, Sudan, Pakistan and a war-ridden Yemen, the most vulnerable among all. <br>
<br>
The data analysis and cleaning was done with Pandas library. <br>The graphs were exported to [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) and finished up in Adobe Illustrator.
